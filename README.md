Artificial intelligence for predicting hospital admissions from the emergency department: a pragmatic randomized clinical trial

Software dependencies and operating systems: The code used in this study is run in Epic’s Nebula cloud computing environment. To use this environment, one must be an Epic customer.

Versions the software has been tested on: The code included was current at the time it was installed for this study. That corresponded to version 2.1 of Epic’s Nebula environment. For the model training code, this was tested with Pandas 1.5.3, scikit-learn 1.2.2, numpy 1.23.5 and xgboost 1.7.6.

Any required non-standard hardware: none.

Installation guide: We did not install any unique software, but rather ran our custom Python code (included) in Epic’s Nebula environment.

Instructions to install and run on data: As above. Epic provides documentation for use of their Nebula environment in their Epic Galaxy web portal, which can be exclusively accessed by those affiliated with Epic customer institutions.

Typical install time: N/A.

Expected output: an array of n probabilities, where n in the number of patients.

Expected run time: <1 minute.

How to run the software on your data: See above.
